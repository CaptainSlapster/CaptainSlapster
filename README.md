- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptainSlapster
- 👀 I’m interested in doing some basic programming to help me learn and get my feet wet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly C# now and starting a bit more basic rather than go straight to C++ or C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that will give me the chance to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me hr3dfox@gmail.com
